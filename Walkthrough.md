# FinAnalyzer Pro: Master Walkthrough

## 1. Data Ingestion
Start by navigating to **Upload Report**. Drag an official corporate earnings release PDF into the dropzone. Gemini 3 Pro will "think" through the document to ensure all non-GAAP and GAAP metrics are correctly identified.

## 2. Analyzing the Dashboard
Upon completion, the Dashboard populates with:
- **Financial summary cards**: High-level KPIs.
- **Sentiment Gauge**: A 0-100 score indicating management's bullishness.
- **Visual Trends**: Interactive charts showing quarterly trajectory.

## 3. Leveraging Market Context
Click the **Market Context** button. The app queries the live web to find news that happened *after* the report was published. This allows you to see if management's optimism was met by market reality.

## 4. Benchmarking (Comparison)
Go to the **Comparison** tab. Select two reports. The system generates a "Delta Analysis" table. This is where you can spot trends like margin compression or accelerating revenue growth YoY.

## 5. Exporting Results
Use the **Export CSV** button in Comparison for raw data modeling, or the **Print Report** button on the Dashboard for a formatted PDF summary for stakeholders.
